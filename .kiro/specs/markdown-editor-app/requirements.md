# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a React application that provides a comprehensive markdown editing experience. The application will feature a split-screen interface where users can write markdown on one side and see a real-time preview on the other side. Additionally, the application will support PDF generation from the markdown content, allowing users to export their documents for sharing or printing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to write markdown in a dedicated editor pane, so that I can focus on content creation with proper syntax highlighting and editing features.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to see a real-time preview of my markdown, so that I can immediately see how my content will be rendered.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types in the editor THEN the system SHALL update the preview pane in real-time
2. WHEN markdown content is rendered THEN the system SHALL display properly formatted HTML with appropriate styling
3. WHEN the preview updates THEN the system SHALL maintain scroll synchronization between editor and preview panes
4. WHEN images are referenced in markdown THEN the system SHALL display them in the preview pane

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to export my markdown content as a PDF, so that I can share or print my documents in a professional format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the export button THEN the system SHALL generate a PDF from the current markdown content
2. WHEN a PDF is generated THEN the system SHALL preserve all formatting including headers, lists, links, and images
3. WHEN a PDF is created THEN the system SHALL allow the user to download the file with a meaningful filename
4. WHEN generating PDF THEN the system SHALL maintain proper page breaks and typography

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to save and load my markdown documents, so that I can work on multiple documents and preserve my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates content THEN the system SHALL provide options to save the document locally
2. WHEN a user wants to open a document THEN the system SHALL allow loading markdown files from the local filesystem
3. WHEN a document is loaded THEN the system SHALL populate both the editor and preview with the file content
4. WHEN a user has unsaved changes THEN the system SHALL warn before closing or loading a new document

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want a responsive and intuitive user interface, so that I can work efficiently on different screen sizes and devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is accessed on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive layout
2. WHEN on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL allow toggling between editor and preview modes
3. WHEN using the interface THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual indicators for all interactive elements
4. WHEN performing actions THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback and loading states
